# Essential Questions for the Computer Science Program:
1.	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
2.	How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
3.	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

	 Interpreting user needs in software development involves actively engaging with stakeholders, understanding their requirements, and utilizing techniques like creating user stories to encapsulate user-centric features. User stories and concise descriptions are written from the users’ perspectives to aid in prioritizing and focusing development efforts. Adopting Agile methodologies such as Scrum shapes the approach to program development. Agile emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability, facilitating continuous improvement. Processes like Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-ups, and Sprint Reviews are integral components of Agile that contribute to effective project management. Incorporating Agile processes into future development work involves planning in short Sprints, daily synchronization, and regular reviews for feedback and reflection. Being a good team member in software development requires effective communication, collaboration, adaptability, and proactive problem-solving to contribute to the overall success of the team and project.
